"""Minimal script for geostationary production.


We take the case of HRIT data from meteosat 9, as send through eumetcast.

- Install mipp, satpy, and pyresample
- Don't forget to set up the PPP_CONFIG_DIR variable to point to your
  configuration files.
- Edit the meteosat09.cfg configuration file (a template is provided in case
  you don't have one) with your HRIT directory:

  .. code-block:: ini

   [seviri-level1]
   format = 'xrit/MSG'
   dir='/data/hrit_in'
   filename='H-000-MSG?__-MSG?________-%(channel)s-%(segment)s-%Y%m%d%H%M-__'
   filename_pro='H-000-MSG?__-MSG?________-_________-%(segment)s-%Y%m%d%H%M-__'
   filename_epi='H-000-MSG?__-MSG?________-_________-%(segment)s-%Y%m%d%H%M-__'

  where `/data/hrit_in` has to be changed to anything that suits your
  environment.

- Here is an example of a minimal script that has to be called as soon as an
  MSG slot has arrived (usually, watching the arrival of the epilogue file
  suffices)
